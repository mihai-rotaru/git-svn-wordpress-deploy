This script uses many bash-specific features, and will _not_ work with other shells.

== Introduction
The idea is to create an additional folder in the project root, where the SVN repository will be generated.

== Features
- remembers options (such as where the SVN folder is, slug, etc) so you don't have to enter them every time
- automatically generates a SVN commit message form all git commit messages since last tag
